# Excel Essentials (Complete Excel Course) by Leila Gharani

I completed this 11 hours course recently. Here's the link for the same: https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-excel-essentials/
The course was really great and a must for everyone who loves excel and frequently uses it.
This repository contains the Excel files in which I practiced and completed the exercise solutions while pursuing the course.
